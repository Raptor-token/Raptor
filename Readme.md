## WHAT IS RAPTOR?
Raptor is a Treasury DAO aiming to become one of the largest community owners of Ether (ETH) in the world.
 
Ether has become the primary reserve currency of the Web3 economy, and there is no better asset to serve as the bedrock for a treasury protocol that can thrive for years to come.

The Treasury and Protocol will be governed by the RAPTOR token, with a predominant Ether treasury actively earning yield, by staking Ethereum 2.0 Validator Nodes to fund our ecosystem and share rewards with holders.â€‹

Our vision is to build a sustainable Treasury and cultivate a strong decentralized brand, for both the metaverse and IRL that's owned and built by its community.

A strong community representing the Raptor will onboard thousands more people into our tribe.

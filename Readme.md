# Raptor [RPTR]

Raptor is an experiment in decentralized community building. Our aim is to become a top 100 Crypto whilst building a 100% decentralized community.
Represented by a decentralized meme token, our community votes and builds projects it wants to pursue with its own funds.

This encourages those who own the most to fund and build an ecosystem around the token. We believe a decentralized community can build something stronger than a centralized team ever could.

The Raptor token (symbol: RPTR) has been deployed to Ethereum mainnet and can be verified here. The tokens are not an investment opportunity.

# Founding Principals

A community-run token is nothing without the people who give it purpose.

Whether you are a new recruit or part of the old guard, if you fly under the Raptor banner, you must embrace our founding principles:

1. We started from zero, with zero. It’s the spirit of our project to create something out of nothing.
2. Starting with nothing means everyone has to bring something to the table.
3. He who controls the memes controls the universe.

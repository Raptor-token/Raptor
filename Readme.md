## WHAT IS RAPTOR?
Raptor is a Treasury DAO focused on becoming one of the largest community-owned Ether (ETH) treasuries. 

Ether has become the primary reserve currency of the Web3 economy and there is no better asset to serve as the bedrock for a treasury protocol that can thrive for years to come. 

The treasury protocol is governed by the RAPTOR token, with a focus on staking Ethereum 2.0 Validator Nodes, deriving an everlasting source of yield to fund the Protocol, Treasury and RaptorDAO. 

Our vision is to build a sustainable treasury and cultivate a strong decentralized brand for both the metaverse and IRL that's owned and built by its community. 

A strong community representing Raptor will onboard thousands more people into our tribe.

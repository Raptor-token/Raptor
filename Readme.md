## WHAT IS RAPTOR?

Raptor is an Ethereum infrastructure DAO focused on maintaining ETH2 Validators, an essential public good, by supporting the infrastructure to onboard the next wave of users into Web3.

We believe the open source roots of Ethereum encourage communities to support each other and support the network. Our vision is to build a decentralized network of validators and strong brand identity that's owned and built by its community. 

Our DAO is governed by the RAPTOR token, with a focus on staking ETH2 Validators, providing an everlasting source of yield.

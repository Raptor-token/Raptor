## WHAT IS RAPTOR?

Raptor is an Ethereum focused DAO operating a network of community owned Validator Nodes, providing an essential public good, and supporting the infrastructure to onboard the next wave of users into Web3.

Ether has become the primary reserve currency of the Web3 economy and there is no better asset to serve as the bedrock for a validator protocol that can thrive for years to come. 

Our DAO is governed by the RAPTOR token, with a focus on staking Ethereum 2.0 Validator Nodes, providing an everlasting source of yield to fund the Protocol, Treasury and RaptorDAO.

Our vision is to build a decentralized network of nodes and strong brand identity that's owned and built by its community. 

A strong community representing Raptor will onboard thousands more people into our tribe.

# Raptor [RPTR]
Raptor is an experiment in decentralized community building. Together we are building a vibrant and growing community with a focus on vertically integrating the Raptor token in all community projects. The Raptor token (symbol: RPTR) has been deployed to Ethereum mainnet. Only 100,000,000 RPTR were minted and no more will ever exist. The tokens are not an investment opportunity.


# Community
Raptor is owned by the community and is an open source project. Our community votes and builds projects it wants to pursue with its own funds. This approach ensures there is no centralized entity, encouraging organic growth of the Raptor ecosystem. We believe through the power of collective decentralization we can build something stronger than a centralized team ever could.


## Founding Principles
The DNA of Raptor is our community. A community-run token is nothing without the people who give it purpose. Whether you are a new recruit or part of the old guard, if you fly under the Raptor banner, you must embrace our founding principles:
1.	It’s the spirit of our project to create something out of nothing.
2.	Starting with nothing means everyone has to bring something to the table.
3. We give back to our community and share what we have learnt.
It is a core philosophy of ours to provide a rich, fun and engaging experience.

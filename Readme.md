# Raptor [RPTR]

Raptor is an experiment in decentralized community building. Our community is represented by a deflationary meme token inspired by the dank meme's that have shaped crypto culture. Our aim is to become a top 100 Crypto whilst building a decentralized community. The Raptor token (symbol: RPTR) has been deployed to Ethereum mainnet. Only 100,000,000 RPTR were minted and no more will ever exist. The tokens are not an investment opportunity.


# Community
Raptor is owned by the community and is 100% Open Source. As an open-source project our community votes and builds projects it wants to pursue with its own funds. This encourages everyone to help fund and build an ecosystem around the token. We believe through the power of collective decentralization we can build something stronger than a centralized team ever could.


## Founding Principles
A community-run token is nothing without the people who give it purpose. Whether you are a new recruit or part of the old guard, if you fly under the Raptor banner, you must embrace our founding principles:
1.	We started from zero, with zero. It’s the spirit of our project to create something out of nothing.
2.	Starting with nothing means everyone has to bring something to the table.
3.	He who controls the memes controls the universe. Memes are the fuel that powers the cryptoworld.
